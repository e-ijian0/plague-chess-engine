# Plague Chess Rules

## Overview
Plague Chess is a variant of chess where pieces can be infected by diseases that affect their behavior.

## Diseases

### The Plague
- A contagious disease that spreads to adjacent pieces each turn.
- Infected pieces cannot move (but can still be captured).
- The Plague spreads at the end of each player's turn to all orthogonally and diagonally adjacent squares that contain a piece (friend or foe). The spread is automatic and does not require the infected piece to move.

### Paralysis
- A disease that prevents a piece from moving.
- A paralyzed piece cannot move, but can still be captured.
- Paralysis does not spread.

## Disease Interactions

### Plague and Paralysis Interaction
A paralyzed piece that is infected with The Plague still spreads The Plague to its adjacent squares. Paralysis only prevents movement; it does not prevent the contagious spread of The Plague.
