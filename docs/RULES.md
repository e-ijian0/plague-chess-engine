# Plague Chess Rules

## Overview
Plague Chess is a variant of chess where pieces can be infected by diseases that affect their behavior.

## Diseases

### The Plague
- A contagious disease that spreads to adjacent pieces each turn.
- Infected pieces cannot move (but can still be captured).
- The Plague spreads at the end of each player's turn to all orthogonally and diagonally adjacent squares that contain a piece (friend or foe). The spread is automatic and does not require the infected piece to move.

### Paralysis
- A disease that prevents a piece from moving.
- A paralyzed piece cannot move, but can still be captured.
- Paralysis does not spread.

## Disease Interactions
Currently, the interaction between The Plague and Paralysis is ambiguous. When a paralyzed piece is infected by The Plague, can it still spread The Plague to its neighbors? This document does not yet specify.
